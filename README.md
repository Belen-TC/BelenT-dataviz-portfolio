# About me
Hi, I’m Belen (she/her)! I’m a first-year Master’s student in the Public Policy and Management - DC track program at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in Biological Sciences from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My passions lie in public policy and advocacy, with a focus on promoting equity, justice, and inclusive societal change.

# What I hope to learn
I am taking this data visualization course to build a strong foundational background in presenting data in a meaningful way. I hope that course projects (including those on this page) will help me learn how to:

- Use tools like Tableau and Datawrapper for data visualization.
- Create graphics that provide important information in a concise yet aesthetically pleasing way.
- Be open to critiquing my own work to understand areas of improvement.

I believe these skills will directly support my career aspirations in policy research. Research becomes more impactful when thoughtful and effective graphics are integrated, as they enhance understanding and engagement with the findings. By gaining proficiency in these areas, I aim to contribute to making research outputs both informative and visually compelling.
