# Changes Made Since Part II
After completing user research in Part II, I focused on identifying key points for my one-minute presentation, which helped guide the creation of visualizations in Tracing the Numbers: Why Data Matters in the Fight for Equity and refining the call to action.

## The Audience
After conducting interviews, I found my target audience had not changed significantly since Part II. The website remains most relevant to individuals interested in engaging with the art world, reinforcing my original intent.

## Final Design Decisions
### Visualizations & Data Collection
To build a clear narrative, I began with the 2019 Topaz et al. study, using a stacked bar graph in Tableau to highlight the ongoing gender gap in museum collections. I then explored potential causes, referencing the Burns Halperin Report (2022), which showed that museum acquisitions and auction sales of women artists remain disproportionately low. To illustrate this, I created a split bar graph in Datawrapper comparing gender representation in acquisitions and sales.

Noting an overlap in frequently exhibited women artists and those with high auction sales, I investigated whether the same applied to men. Using Topaz et al.’s data, I created a line graph in Tableau to show gender disparities in permanent collections by birth year. My final visualization emphasized that just five women artists accounted for nearly half of global auction sales over the past 11.6 years. To make this disparity clear, I chose a grouped bar graph instead of a pie chart, ensuring the financial gap was more visible.

### Technical Adjustments
After integrating the visualizations into Shorthand, I encountered formatting issues with Tableau graphs being cut off. Adjusting the width to 1200px caused misalignment, so I kept it consistent with the text, even though it slightly compressed the x-axes. I also noticed that my original color scheme (light pink and lavender) might not be distinguishable for individuals with color blindness, so I switched to light pink and dark pink for better accessibility. Additionally, the font I used did not display correctly in Shorthand or Tableau Public, and I was unable to fix this issue.

### Refining the Call to Action
Initially, I created an interactive scrollpoint animation with four action steps, and feedback suggested the recommendations could be more actionable. After writing out the recommendations, I found it difficult to conclude effectively and keep my presentation concise. To streamline the message, I focused on a single action: encouraging readers to visit museums featuring women-led exhibitions. This aligned with the website’s core message and allowed for a stronger conclusion. I also simplified the animation so the image fades in as readers scroll.


# Final thoughts
I really enjoyed working on this project. It allowed me to put into practice everything I learned in the course. While there were moments of frustration, especially when my visualizations didn’t turn out as expected or when I struggled to find the right datasets, the experience greatly improved my data visualization skills.

If I had more time and practice, I would have liked to create an interactive map of current exhibitions. I had this idea from the beginning of the project, but I wasn’t able to dedicate enough time to building an effective map, especially since I’m not yet completely comfortable with that type of visualization. Additionally, Tableau already presented challenges, particularly when embedding graphs into Shorthand.

Despite these challenges, I believe I successfully created the compelling narrative I envisioned in Part 1. I also appreciated being able to maintain the colors and stylistic choices inspired by Hung Liu’s Winter With Cynical Fish. The color scheme played a key role in tying the story together and helped engage the audience during my presentation.
