# Storyboard
Link to [Shorthand Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/hEDLlpyhC9OgajWS)

To begin the storyboard, I first outlined the story in a Google Doc. This helped ensure that I included all key points and allowed me to determine the most effective order for each section. Since I was unfamiliar with Shorthand, I figured writing everything out in a simple document would save time, as I could easily copy and paste the text later. Additionally, reviewing the content across different formats (Google Docs, Shorthand, and data visualizations) helped me catch errors and identify areas for improvement.

Once I had the foundation of the story, I began working in Shorthand. From the start, I envisioned a timeline spanning from 1989 to 2025, with decade-specific information and accompanying graphs appearing as users scrolled. However, as I analyzed the datasets, I realized that many articles referenced the same limited sources. I also discovered that the Topaz et al. study was the first and only large-scale analysis of diversity in U.S. art museums. While this reinforced the need to raise awareness about representation gaps, it also meant I had less data to work with than I initially expected. To adapt, I revised my approach, rather than focusing on a full timeline of statistics, I decided to highlight pivotal moments in advocacy efforts.

At first, I included only five key years in the timeline, using Shorthand’s “Timelines” template as a starting point. I created a visual timeline in Canva, incorporating free stock images provided by the website. Uploading the timeline into Shorthand presented some challenges, particularly in setting up scroll points, but once I figured it out, I found the platform relatively easy to use (though still a bit glitchy).

One of my biggest questions was whether to integrate data visualizations into the timeline. Since not every event had enough numerical data to support a chart, I decided to address this during my interviews. After gathering feedback, I realized that adding graphs to the timeline made it visually overwhelming, as I had already included several images. Instead, I expanded the timeline to seven events, correcting some dates along the way. This allowed me to reserve the data-heavy visualizations for the next section, where I plan to present statistics on representation shifts between 2008 and 2018.

I am still finalizing these visualizations in Tableau and Datawrapper. During testing, I noticed that Shorthand does not fully support Tableau graphs, distorting the font and display. If I am unable to resolve this issue, I may explore alternative tools for presenting the data.

# User Research 

## Target Audience
Since my target audience is students interested in art history, gender studies, public policy, or cultural studies (whom are also likely to enjoy visiting museums and galleries) I wanted to ensure the visualizations and storyboard were engaging and easy to understand. To gather feedback, I primarily interviewed fellow classmates, as they closely align with the intended audience. Their insights helped me refine the presentation, ensuring that key takeaways were clear and the visuals effectively conveyed the data.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Are key facts highlighted and noticeable    | When looking at the timeline, where is your eye drawn?                 |
| at should be the main focus?     | Would it be helpful to have related visualizations within the timeline events?                 |
|Determine the best structure for presenting information.      |Would placing data visualizations in a separate section improve clarity?                   |
|Assess color scheme effectiveness and overall readability.      | Is anything difficult to see or understand?                  |
|Ensure the story resonates with the target audience.      | Who do you think the intended audience is?                  |
|Gather ideas for expanding the content. | Is there anything else you would like to see? Additional visualizations? |

# Moodboard

![women artists vision board](./Women%20Artists%20Mood%20Board.png)
To refine the color scheme, typography, and overall design for my Shorthand presentation and data visualizations, I created a mood board. While researching similar infographics, I noticed that pink was frequently used for topics related to gender equity in the arts. Although I liked the aesthetic, I was concerned that pairing pink with blue might reinforce gender stereotypes. To avoid this, I decided to expand the color palette while maintaining the softness of pink.

For inspiration, I turned to Hung Liu’s painting Winter With Cynical Fish, featured in the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The painting’s blend of soft purples, pinks, and grays became the foundation of my color scheme. I then built upon this by selecting additional colors from other artworks, ultimately curating a cohesive six-color palette.

The mood board also includes typography samples, allowing me to see how my chosen fonts appear against different backgrounds. Maintaining consistent typography across Shorthand, graphs, and infographics will help create a unified visual flow. Additionally, I gathered examples of past data visualizations to use as inspiration for presenting my own findings.

Creating this mood board will streamline the design process and prevent me from overthinking minor aesthetic choices. By finalizing colors and fonts in advance, I can focus on assembling the final presentation without unnecessary delays.
