# Makeover Monday 
For this assignment, we were tasked with critiquing and redesigning a visualization from [Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/). The process consisted of five steps designed to guide the creation of an effective visualization. Below is a breakdown of my work through each step.

## Step One: The Visualization

For step one, we had to choose a visualization from Makeover Monday to work with. Makeover Monday is a website that publishes a new visualization every week along with a dataset, allowing participants to create more effective visualizations.

For my project, I selected a visualization featured on the website in April 2023, titled "Which Country Produces the Most Tomatoes." The original visualization (pictured below) was posted in the LinkedIn group "Business Intelligence, Analytics & Data Visualization" and was created using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

I chose this visualization because I had never seen an animated bar graph used to show changes over time, making it an interesting challenge to critique and redesign. Since it features animation and various design elements, I considered it outside my usual skill set, which added to the learning opportunity. Additionally, the LinkedIn post provided very little context for the visualization, giving me the chance to rework it in a way that tells a clearer and more compelling story.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
