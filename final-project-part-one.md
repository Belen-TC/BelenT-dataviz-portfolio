# Outline
In 1989, the feminist activist group Guerrilla Girls launched a poster campaign across New York City with the provocative question: *"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?"* The campaign stemmed from their discovery that while fewer than 5% of the artists in the museum’s Modern Art section were women, 85% of the nude artworks depicted women (*Naked Through the Ages — Guerrilla Girls, n.d.*). Despite reissuing the poster in 2005 and 2012, the statistics remained largely unchanged. Over the years, various campaigns have sought to raise awareness about gender disparities in the art world.  

For my final project, I aim to highlight the impact of these campaigns and their ongoing efforts. I will analyze initiatives from the Guerrilla Girls, Pussy Galore, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts to examine how representation in art spaces has evolved. Key data points will include the number of women artists featured in collections, artwork acquisitions, price disparities, and pay inequities. By presenting these figures, I hope to illustrate the persistent lack of diversity in the art world and the challenges women artists continue to face.  

To ensure the project is not solely focused on the negative, I will emphasize the campaigns’ successes and how they inspire action. The project will conclude with a list of current exhibitions showcasing women artists and actionable steps for involvement—such as engaging with social media movements like #5WomenArtists, educating ourselves on gender disparities in art, and signing petitions advocating for greater representation.  

Below is a visual outline of how I plan to structure the project’s narrative.

# The data
To gather data, I plan to consult sources that provide both historical context on advocacy campaigns and specific statistics on women's representation in museums.  

For historical data, I will explore the websites of the campaigns mentioned in this [PBS News article](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/people-can-name-five-female-artists-can). Many of these sites contain archives of past initiatives, including their goals, outreach impact, and promotional materials such as posters, infographics, and flyers.  

For representation data, I have identified several sources through the National Museum of Women in the Arts website. Additionally, Artnet and the National Endowment for the Arts publish reports on the demographics of artists in the U.S. Using these sources, I aim to create data visualizations comparing women artists to other groups.  

I also plan to incorporate academic research on diversity in museums. Several studies provide detailed analyses of representation gaps and conclude with recommendations for change. These findings will serve as a foundation for my call to action, reinforcing the need for greater equity in the art world.
