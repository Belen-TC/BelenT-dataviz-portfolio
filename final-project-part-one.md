# Outline
In 1989, the feminist activist group Guerrilla Girls launched a poster campaign across New York City with the provocative question: *"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met Museum?"* The campaign stemmed from their discovery that while fewer than 5% of the artists in the museum’s Modern Art section were women, 85% of the nude artworks depicted women (*Naked Through the Ages — Guerrilla Girls, n.d.*). Despite reissuing the poster in 2005 and 2012, the statistics remained largely unchanged. Over the years, various campaigns have sought to raise awareness about gender disparities in the art world.  

For my final project, I aim to highlight the impact of these campaigns and their ongoing efforts. I will analyze initiatives from the Guerrilla Girls, Pussy Galore, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts to examine how representation in art spaces has evolved. Key data points will include the number of women artists featured in collections, artwork acquisitions, price disparities, and pay inequities. By presenting these figures, I hope to illustrate the persistent lack of diversity in the art world and the challenges women artists continue to face.  

To ensure the project is not solely focused on the negative, I will emphasize the campaigns’ successes and how they inspire action. The project will conclude with a list of current exhibitions showcasing women artists and actionable steps for involvement—such as engaging with social media movements like #5WomenArtists, educating ourselves on gender disparities in art, and signing petitions advocating for greater representation.  

Below is a visual outline of how I plan to structure the project’s narrative.

## Initial sketches
For my initial sketches, I had only a general idea of the types of visualizations I wanted to create and how best to design them. I used this sketching process to experiment with color schemes and explore different ways to represent the data I found online.

For example, I initially thought pie charts would be the best way to display the Guerrilla Girls' statistics on the percentage of women artists in the Met Museum’s modern art section. However, while sketching, I considered ways to enhance the design to better emphasize the disparity. A tree map, for instance, might be more effective in illustrating proportions.

I also realized that much of the data would be best represented using line graphs to show changes over time. This led me to explore different ways to visualize trends dynamically.

The second part of my sketches focused on designing the layout of my Shorthand website. I envision it as a timeline, starting with 1989 at the top and progressing to 2025 at the bottom. As users scroll, they will see decade-specific graphs, and I may include a line graph on the side that expands to show overall trends over time.

For the call to action at the bottom of the page, I want to create an interactive map—similar to one I found [online](https://www.galleriesnow.net/artmap/usa/), that highlights current exhibitions featuring women artists. This would provide viewers with a direct way to engage with the issue and explore ongoing efforts to improve representation.

# The data
To gather data, I plan to consult sources that provide both historical context on advocacy campaigns and specific statistics on women's representation in museums.  

For historical data, I will explore the websites of the campaigns mentioned in this [PBS News article](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/people-can-name-five-female-artists-can). Many of these sites contain archives of past initiatives, including their goals, outreach impact, and promotional materials such as posters, infographics, and flyers.  

For representation data, I have identified several sources through the National Museum of Women in the Arts website. Additionally, Artnet and the National Endowment for the Arts publish reports on the demographics of artists in the U.S. Using these sources, I aim to create data visualizations comparing women artists to other groups.  

I also plan to incorporate academic research on diversity in museums. Several studies provide detailed analyses of representation gaps and conclude with recommendations for change. These findings will serve as a foundation for my call to action, reinforcing the need for greater equity in the art world.

# Method and medium
For my final project, I plan to use Shorthand to create an interactive website that presents the information outlined in my plan. The website will feature graphics and visualizations, which I will create using tools like Tableau and Datawrapper.
